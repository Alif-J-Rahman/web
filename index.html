<h2> What is Minecraft <h2>
<p> Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language (very cool we that we will 
  be learning this). It is one of the most popular games of all time. In Minecraft. players expolore a blocky, 3D world with infitite terrain, and can discover the 
  world and harvest it's resources to eventually beat the game by defeating the final boss: the Ender Dragon. Anyone of any age can play this game and have massive 
  amounts of fun and get joy out of it. This is because Minecraft is a place where you can let your creativity run free... you can build massive structures, design 
  arenas, roleplay, and overall you can do almost anything by yourself or with friends. </p>

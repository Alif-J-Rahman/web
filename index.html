<h2> What is Minecraft </h2>
<p> Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language (very cool we that we 
  will be learning this). It is one of the most popular games of all time. In Minecraft. players expolore a blocky, 3D world with infitite terrain, and can discover 
  the world and harvest it's resources to eventually beat the game by defeating the final boss: the Ender Dragon. Anyone of any age can play this game and have massive 
  amounts of fun and get joy out of it. This is because Minecraft is a place where you can let your creativity run free... you can build massive structures, design 
  arenas, roleplay, and overall you can do almost anything by yourself or with friends. </p>

<h2> How did I find out about Minecraft </h2>
<p> I think the way that I found out about Minecraft is very unique. The details are a bit fuzzy but I will try to convery my story as clearly as possible: I think in 
  second grade, I was working on an assignment with a group. Now obviously we started chatting about random things other than the assignment since we were second 
  graders. One friend told me if I know what "What does the Fox say" is. I told him I don't. He told me to go to this website I have never heard of, Youtube, and 
  search it up there. So afterschool, jolly 'ole me decided to exactly that. However, I never even got to the music video. Instead, I watched an Annoying Orange video 
  of "What does the sock say". This introduce me to Annoying Orange's channel and I began to watch it regularly. As you might have guessed, the channel uploaded a 
  video about Minecraft and I was immediatly intrigued. Following the end of that video, I searched up Minecraft in Youtube and found tons of communities and content
  creators based around Minecraft and have been hooked on the game ever since. </p>
